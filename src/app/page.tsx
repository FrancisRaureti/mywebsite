      <p>
        I'm currently a Painter/Contractor but am looking to change fields into the tech industry. I have a BS in Computer Science, completed at the Victoria University of Wellington in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a passion for software design and engineering and would like to make it a focus of my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to improve my skills and would love for my profession to match my hobby. Having the opportunity to develop my craft consistently is important to me.

      <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left">
        I finished college in 2011 at Horowhenua College in Levin, where I worked part-time at the local Mitre 10.
        After graduating, I moved to full-time work and used my earnings to fund overseas trips to Europe and Australia. During that time, I earned a managerâ€™s position overseeing the paint, electrical, and seasonal departments.
        <br /><br />
        In 2016, I felt I could be doing more and enrolled at Victoria University to study Computer Science. I worked part-time for Resene Paints Ltd in Wellington throughout my studies until shortly after graduating.
        Due to a back injury from sitting for long hours, I transitioned into a more physical role with Paragon Painting Contractors.
